# Speech Recognition Project

This project is a basic implementation of a speech recognition system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating a natural language processing API (such as the Web Speech API) to convert spoken words into text. It allows users to interact with the web application through voice commands, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: The application captures speech and translates it into text using speech recognition.
- **Real-Time Output**: Displays the recognized text in real time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and responsive UI built with HTML and CSS.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works with modern browsers that support speech recognition (like Google Chrome).
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles the web interface to ensure it is visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the core logic of the speech recognition functionality.
- **Natural Speech API**: Utilizes the Web Speech API (or another similar API) for speech-to-text conversion.

## How It Works

1. **Start Listening**: The application starts listening for voice input when the user clicks a button or activates a microphone.
2. **Speech Recognition**: The speech is processed by the speech recognition API.
3. **Display Results**: The recognized text is displayed in real time in a text area.
4. **Repeat or Reset**: Users can repeat the process or reset the application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/Aishwarya05-oss/Code-meet.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd speech-recognition-project
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (Google Chrome is recommended).

## Usage

1. Open the web application.
2. Click the "Start" button to enable the microphone and begin speaking.
3. The spoken words will be transcribed into text in real time.
4. Click the "Stop" button to stop the speech recognition.

```

## API Used

The project uses the **Web Speech API** (or any other natural language processing API) to handle speech-to-text conversion. The Web Speech API is supported by most modern browsers and offers seamless voice recognition capabilities.

## Browser Compatibility

This project works best in:
- **Google Chrome**: Full support for the Web Speech API
- **Edge**: Limited support
- **Firefox**: No native support (use with polyfill)

## Future Enhancements

- Adding support for multiple languages.
- Implementing voice commands to control webpage elements.
- Saving the transcribed text to a file.
- Integrating text-to-speech features.
